# Singapore Green Plan 2030 Benchmarking

This project benchmarks Singapore’s sustainability performance against selected indicators aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the UN SDGs. Using World Bank ESG data, the analysis evaluates trends over time and compares Singapore’s performance against regional and economic peers.

Key insights:
- Singapore shows steady but uneven progress toward Green Plan goals.
- Performance is competitive relative to peers, though not leading.
- Economic growth appears increasingly decoupled from carbon emissions.
- Greater consistency and acceleration will be required to meet 2030 targets.
